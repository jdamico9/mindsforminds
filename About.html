           <b>Who we are:</b> 
           Minds for Minds is a nonprofit organization formed in 2020 by Jameson D'Amico. Here at Minds for Minds, our minds work for your mind! We were founded with the 
           purpose of providing aid and resources to teenagers suffering from mental health issues. From teens, for teens. We know that many teenagers are uncomfortable asking
           adults for help, and with Minds for Minds they no longer have to! This organization was founded by teens, for teens. 
        </p>

            <b>What we do:</b> 
            Here at Minds for Minds, we believe mental health is key to success and growth. No matter what you are doing, you'll never be able to reach your full potential if you aren't happy and healthy while doing it.
            We understand that, but we also understand how hard it can be to reach out and ask for help sometimes. It can feel awkward and uncomfortable to ask an adult, and so you may want advice from people your own age. That is
            what Minds for Minds is here to help with! Although we can't give you personal advice, there are several ways in which we can help! At Minds for Minds, we are focused on providing resources
            to teenagers who are seeking them. We also collect donations to expnd and enhance the mental health resources in our community, as well as to help other local mental health organizations.

            <b>Future Plans:</b> 
            At Minds for Minds, we are always looking to grow and expand. There are always people to help and we want to make sure we can reach as many of them as possible. 
            Although we are more than satisfied with our current operations, we are always working to expand adn grow! In the future, we are hoping to be able to do community outreach.
            We would love the opportunity to go to schools or libraries and talk to teenagers about mental health, why it is so important, and how they can get the mental health help they need
            through services such as Minds for Minds. Furthermore, we would also like to partner with other mental health organizations in the United States, with the goal
            of reaching an even broader population. Lastly, we hope to expand our system of communication in the future. We would like to set up a chat system as well as enhance the visual
            and performance aspects of our websites. We will strive to accomplish these goals in the future!
